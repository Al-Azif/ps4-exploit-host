PS4 Exploit Host FAQ
====================

- Github issues are not for exploit/payload requests.
- Github issues are not for issues with payloads/exploits. They are provided in releases as a convenience.
- Github issues are not for issues with my DNS servers.
- Yes... I know 1/3 anti-virus applications detect this as malware. There are a few reasons for this:
    - The binaries extract files to the temp folder
    - The code, which the AV can see, contains the word 'exploit' and 'payload'
    - The application opens 2 privileged ports (53 & 80) then runs servers on themselves
    - The exploits directory in the releases contain exploits for remote code execution... duh...
    - If you don't trust the binaries, download the python release and use that. You can see all the code as it's a scripting language
    - If you want to help to try to get this white listed contact your anti-virus vendor and submit it to them for analysis. You can also upload it to VirusTotal and comment/vote on it there.
    - If you open a issue about this (Or message me elsewhere about it), I'll close it, block you, and move on with my day. Can you tell I'm tired of the malware comments?
